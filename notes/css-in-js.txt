CSS in JSS: defining styles in js code
    as opposed to in external css files

Technique 1: in-line styles:
    <div style={ styleObject }>
    where styleObject is an object of
    type React.CSSProperties (basically css but with camel-case names)
    this is what we have used all thru class
    one possible draw back: performance

Technique 2: 3rd party css-in-js libraries
    the two i use are:
        jss (used by material-ui)
        jsxstyle
    Works similar to inline styles
        but generates <style>  </style> elements
        and adds them to your html page
