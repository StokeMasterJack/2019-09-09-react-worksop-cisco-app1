context:
    analogous to java's thread local (one step less than global)
    scope is the call stack (not quite global)
    saves one from having to pass the same object down the component tree

f0
    f1 = state:{g:Game)
        f2a(props:g)

        f2b(props:g)
            f3b(props:g)
                f4b(props:g)
                    f5b(props:g)

        f2c(context:g)
            f3c
                f4c
                    f5c
                        can access context
useContext:
    best way to use a context object is with the useContext hook
