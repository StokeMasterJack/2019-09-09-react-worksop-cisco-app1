CSS in JSS
    one possible draw back: performance
        only if using inline styles like: <div style={{backgroundColor:'yellow}}/>
    solution: 3rd party css-in-js libraries:
        jss
        jsxstyle

case of tag name (first letter):
    lower: native dom html element
        <div>
        <input>
    upper: react component
        <App/>
        <Red/>

create-react-app
    npm start:
        starts of a virtual server
        no js files actually generated (all done in memory)
    npm build:
        creates built version of app for production deployment
        uses cache-forever js file names (i.e. hash based)

hooks
    useXxx
    useState
    useContext
    useEffect

returning null or false from a UI component
    renders nothing

virtual dom is actually small (smaller than u might think) due to conditional rendering
