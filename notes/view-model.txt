view = f(model)

where model is:
    props
    state
    context

Basically, your app's data is stored as "state",
    then, parts of that data are passed
    down (immutably) to the child components
    in the form of props or context

props:
    must be explicitly passed from parent to child
    as a "props"

context:
    once an object is placed in the "context"
    it is *implicitly* passed to all child components

props and context are immutable
state is mutable

data that is state (higher in the tree)
    is props or context lower in the tree
