refs are used to store any mutable data that does not trigger a react re-render.

ref vs state:
    Both are mutable
    Changing a "state" value triggers a re-render.
    Changing a "ref" value DOES NOT trigger a re-render.

useRef:
    If you have some mutable state that is not stored as react "state"
    u can store it in a ref object using the useState hook.

    const ref = useRef<HTMLInputElement | null>(null);
    the type of ref (in this case) is:
        MutableRefObject<HTMLInputElement | null>

    it can be updated like this:
        ref.current = someHtmlElement

refs for html dom elements:
    refs were originally used just for references (and mutating)
        the native (and mutable) dom elements
        which are normally (for the most part) hidden from react developers.

    But refs can be used to store any mutable data that does not trigger a re-render.
