effect (side-effect):
    in functional programming, a *pure function* is a function that:
        a. returns a value based *solely* on the functions arguments.
        b. does not change (or do) anything outside of the function beyond
           simply returning a value.
           i.e. does not mutate any global or static or instance vars.
                does not write to a db, make an ajax call, etc.

    a function *does* change something outside of the function is said to
       have "side-effects".

    in react, many functions make state changes. So when we say side-effect
       in react, we mean a side-effect other than a state change.

useEffect:
    In React, the standard way to invoke "side-effect functions"
    is with the useEffect hook. Mainly to call ajax services.
